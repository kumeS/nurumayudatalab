**Issues Fixed**: 3 additional bugs

## Bug #7: Right-Click Menu Not Displaying

### Problem
The right-click menu was not appearing when right-clicking on nodes. Console showed an error: `ReferenceError: canvasPosition is not defined`.

### Root Cause
Line 50 in `canvasController.js` referenced an undefined variable `canvasPosition` in a console.log statement that was accidentally left from previous refactoring.

### Solution
```javascript
// BEFORE (line 50)
console.log('Found node:', nodeId, 'at canvas position:', canvasPosition);

// AFTER
console.log('Found node:', nodeId, 'at position:', domPosition);
```

### Files Changed
- `js/canvasController.js` (line 50)

### Impact
✅ Right-click menu now displays correctly  
✅ No console errors when right-clicking  
✅ Node detection works properly

## Bug #8: Circle Menu Not Reusable (One-Time Display)

### Problem
The circle menu would only display once. After the first use, subsequent right-clicks would not show the menu because `createCircleMenu()` was deleting and recreating the menu element each time, breaking event listeners.

### Root Cause
The `createCircleMenu()` method was:
1. Removing existing menu: `this.circleMenu.remove()`
2. Creating new menu element
3. Adding to DOM
4. Event listeners were not properly re-attached to the new element

### Solution
Modified `createCircleMenu()` to reuse the existing menu element:

```javascript
// BEFORE
createCircleMenu() {
    // Clean up existing menu if present
    if (this.circleMenu) {
        this.circleMenu.remove();
    }
    // ... create new menu
}

// AFTER
createCircleMenu() {
    // Return early if menu already exists
    if (this.circleMenu && document.body.contains(this.circleMenu)) {
        console.log('Circle menu already exists, reusing it');
        return;
    }
    // ... only create if doesn't exist
}
```

### Additional Improvements in `showCircleMenu()`
- Added cleanup at the start: `this.hideCircleMenu()` before showing
- Increased delay for document click handler from 100ms → 200ms
- Added check to prevent closing during right-click: `e.button !== 2`

### Files Changed
- `js/canvasController.js` (lines 346-350, 584-585, 643-656)

### Impact
✅ Circle menu can be displayed multiple times  
✅ Menu remains stable and doesn't disappear unexpectedly  
✅ Event handlers work consistently across multiple uses  
✅ Better performance by reusing DOM elements

## Feature #1: Single-Click Active Mode

### Problem
Users had to double-click nodes to view details. This was not intuitive and required an extra action.

### User Request
> "ノードはone clickでactive modeになるようにして"
> (Make nodes enter active mode with a single click)

### Solution
Modified `handleNodeClick()` to show node details panel on single click:

```javascript
// BEFORE
handleNodeClick(nodeId, event) {
    const multiSelect = event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey;
    workflowEngine.selectNode(nodeId, multiSelect);
    
    if (workflowEngine.mode === 'connect') {
        this.handleConnection(nodeId);
    }
}

// AFTER
handleNodeClick(nodeId, event) {
    const multiSelect = event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey;
    workflowEngine.selectNode(nodeId, multiSelect);
    
    if (workflowEngine.mode === 'connect') {
        this.handleConnection(nodeId);
    } else {
        // Single click activates node detail panel (active mode)
        this.showNodeDetails(nodeId);
    }
}
```

### Files Changed
- `js/canvasController.js` (lines 1140-1150)

### Impact
✅ Single click now opens node detail panel  
✅ More intuitive user experience  
✅ Faster workflow - one less click required  
✅ Double-click still works for backward compatibility

## Recommendations

1. **Add visual feedback** when nodes enter active mode (e.g., highlight border)
2. **Consider adding keyboard shortcuts** for common operations (e.g., Space to open node details)
3. **Add tooltip** on first use explaining single-click behavior
4. **Test on different browsers** to ensure right-click menu works consistently
